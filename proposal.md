# MAJOR PROJECT PROPOSAL - CLICKER GAME

## DESCRIPTION
I want to make a clicker game in which someone clicks on the item in the middle to get money. Every few seconds they get another set base amount of money, and then can purchase upgrades to increase money "production". I want to make a store in which the upgrades can be bought, as well as add different noises for each location the user can click on (store, purchases, sprite, etc). I don't think there will ever be an end to the game, but there will be a limited amount of upgrades that they can get. 


## NEED TO HAVES:
  - "money" collection ✔
  - permanent upgrades to be purchased 
    -                                                             sprite upgrades, make them look different 
    - speed up money production ✔
    - more money per click ✔
  - A store to purchase the upgrades in ✔
  - a coin to click on to get money ✔
  - noise/graphics when clicked ✔
  -                                                                 background music
  - a nice background, maybe not just a plain colour? ✔ // changed my mind and liked the minimalist look 

## NICE TO HAVES:
  - restart game when you get to a certain point and start again with better original 
  - another type of money
    - used to purchase BETTER upgrades 
    - buy these with original money type
    - like diamonds in any IOS game meant for kids
    - timed upgrades
  - pop up for the store instead of switching whole screen ✔ 
  - fun graphics instead of boring ones
  - works with different resolutions
