## BETA TESTERS



# out of class beta tester 1 - my dad, ie dude with a computer science degree


- Your "Cookie Counter" / scoreboard at the top is a little hard to read. Perhaps put it on a solid background.

    - fixed, is on a brown wood background now

- The benefit of your various bakers is labeled inconsistently. What I mean by this is that your first three are labeled as CPS, and your last three are labeled as + X cookies. You should one or the other.

    - not fixed because that was intentional, CPS means the purchase increases your clicks per second whereas  + X cookies means that affects the amount of cookies per click on the cookie

- Clair Saffitz is touching the edge of its button box. This won't be an issue if you make the change from # 2 to CPS.

    - i think its okay because it's still legible 

- I like  the way your cookie changes size when you click it. 

    - why thank you i stole that idea directly from the original game

- The background graphic is a nice touch, too! You might want to find a higher resolution pic though, as it gets a little blurry when it's in a big browser window. 

    - fixed i think, my image looks fine when its small and big

- Are you going to add any other things to spend your cookies on? 

    - considered it, ran out of time. was going to be able to purchase new music to play while youre playing

- Could you put a sound effect on clicking the cookie? 

    - ADDED this as well as noise when you click on the upgrades



# in class beta tester, ie Josh


- "could use more sound"

    - added background music and mutilated homer simpson woohoooo and click noise

- "10/10 would click again"

    - why thank you



# out of class beta tester 2 - a friend with no clue how computers work


- Your game is great!
    - why thank you
-  It's fun and easy to use the design is quick to pick up and I didn't see any bugs. 
    - good stuff
- The gameplay is simple but fun. 
    - thank
- The counter started climbing too quickly when I had too many cookies per second which was funny. 
    - it might look glitchy but i can't slow that down without changing the amount of cookies he was making
- A suggestion for improvments could be adding a sound effect when you buy a new chef but overall it was great!
    - did that! horribly mutilated homer!
